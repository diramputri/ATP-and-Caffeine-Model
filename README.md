Caffeine is the most widely consumed stimulant on the market, commonly found in drinks, food,
and medicine. Caffeine’s role in health sciences is quite ambiguous; some scientists say it provides
sustained energy throughout the day, which helps grow muscle and deplete fat if taken advantage
of. Others claim caffeine provides a temporary burst of energy. To study this issue, we study
caffeine’s regulation of adenosine triphosphate’s (ATP) baseline production within a spherical
human. After researching caffeine’s pharmacokinetics and several metabolic cycles, including
lipolysis and beta oxidation, we developed a system of ordinary differential equations. We
performed dynamical systems analysis on the equations by finding its steady state values and
eigenvalues. Caffeine is quantitatively shown to increase the production of ATP, giving the
spherical human sustained energy.
